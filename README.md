# Sentiment-Analysis

📊 Sentiment Analysis using NLTK - GitHub Repository - By Akshat Sanghvi 📊

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my Sentiment Analysis project using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library! 🚀

## Project Overview:
In this project, I performed sentiment analysis on the [IMDB 50,000 movie reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) dataset from __Kaggle__. The main objective was to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the emotions expressed in the text.

## Key Features:      
🔍 __Data Exploration:__ I started by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and content. Understanding the dataset was crucial for designing an effective sentiment analysis solution.

💡 __Text Preprocessing:__ To prepare the text data for analysis, I applied various text preprocessing techniques, including removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling stop words.

🧮 __Tokenization and Feature Engineering:__ The NLTK library played a central role in tokenizing the text data and engineering meaningful features from the raw text.

🤖 __Sentiment Classification:__ I implemented machine learning models to classify the movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments. In my experiments, I found that ensemble techniques really work well for such projects.

📈 __Performance Evaluation:__ Model evaluation was a critical step in the project. I utilized various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's performance and ensure its reliability. Also, in the end, I used seasborn library to visualise the confusion matrix. I also analyzed and visualised various important features affecting our classifier.

## How to Use:
To replicate the analysis and explore the results, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone - https://github.com/iiakshat/Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLTK
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Notebook.ipynb` or `notebook.pdf` to access the complete code and documentation.

4. Execute each cell in the notebook to replicate the analysis step-by-step.
